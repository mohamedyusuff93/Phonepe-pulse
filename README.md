Project Goals:
      The PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project aims to:
      Extract data from the PhonePe Pulse Github repository.
      Transform and preprocess the data using Python and libraries like Pandas.
      Store the processed data in a MySQL database.
      Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
      Enable users to explore and visualize their transaction data effectively.
Approach:
Data Extraction:
      Clone the Github repository to fetch data related to various metrics and statistics.
      Store the data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON).
Data Transformation:
      Use Python and Pandas to manipulate and preprocess the data.
      Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.
Database Insertion:
      Connect to a MySQL database using the “mysql-connector-python” library.
      Insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
Dashboard Creation:
      Utilize Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.
      Display data trends, facts, and figures in a user-friendly manner.
